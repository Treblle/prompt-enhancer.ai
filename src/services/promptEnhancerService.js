    twitter: {
        technical: `You're an experienced software engineer and technology expert writing a **one-liner tweet (under 280 characters)** for Twitter/X. Your goal is to deliver a **concise, original insight** on **{{topic}}**—crafted for developers and technical professionals who value clarity, real-world experience, and no fluff.

🎯 OBJECTIVE:
Write a **single tweet** that:
* Offers a fresh, memorable perspective on {{topicSubject}} development
* Uses contrast, paradox, or parallelism to increase retention and quotability
* Avoids clichés, jargon, or AI-sounding phrasing
* Stands alone as a complete, powerful idea (no threads)

✅ INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Length Limit**: 240–280 characters (longer one-liner, not a thread)
2. **Core Format**: One sharp insight—crafted like a quote, not a summary
3. **Tech Focus**: Insight should reflect a deeper truth or overlooked best practice in {{topicDetail}} ({{topicAspects}}, etc.)
4. **Style**:
   * Use plainspoken, modern language—write like a human, not a headline bot
   * Use **active voice** and **present tense** for punchiness
   * Keep it direct—no setup, no follow-up, no "here's why" explanations

✒️ PRO TIPS FOR STYLE:
* Use **parallel structure**: "{{parallelExample}}"
* Use **unexpected contrast**: "{{contrastExample}}"
* Use **concrete phrasing**: Replace abstract terms like "optimize" or "implement" with real-world behavior or code insights
* Make it **quotable**: Imagine this tweet on a dev conference slide

🚫 AVOID:
* Clickbait or engagement-bait ("🔥" / "Must-know!" / "Let that sink in.")
* Threads, hashtags, or emojis
* AI-sounding phrases or vague abstractions
* Explaining the insight—just state it clearly and let it land`

Your content should demonstrate genuine expertise and offer unique perspectives not commonly found in basic articles on this topic.

• I want to write a humanized blog. I also want you to use the storytelling approach and always use a real-world example to explain it. 
• Please do not use any generic or utilized examples. 
• We need uniqueness, which is not available on the internet now. 
• Please write it in a good format and structure. 
• Cover all the important things that should be in this blog. 
• Please continue the blog if the text limit is reached, but please write it in very detail and explain exactly the same. 
• Please do not use "—" between words to add fillers.
• Please do not use AI, marketing, flashy, sales pitch type tone, keywords, sentences, or anything that sounds AI-generated. Please also keep it technical-focused for developers.  Please do not use vague or unused sentences that make it an off-moment for the developers. Please write the whole blog in ACTIVE VOICE. 

AI-Generated & Marketing Jargon to Avoid
These words feel robotic, exaggerated, or like they belong in a sales pitch rather than a technical blog.

Tones & Writing Styles to Avoid
Overly Formal – It feels like a whitepaper rather than an engaging read.
Overly Casual – Avoid forced humor, unnecessary jokes, or slang that doesn't resonate with developers.
Sales Pitch Tone – The goal is education, not selling a tool or service.
AI-Sounding Tone – Avoid phrasing that feels overly structured or synthetic.

Structure your content with clear sections, each delivering specific value. Use professional but conversational tone, employ concrete specific language, and use active voice throughout.

Be original, specific, and demonstrate genuine expertise on this topic.`;

- Don't use vague instructions like "write engaging content" - be specific about HOW to make it engaging
- Always include a specific framework or structure that the AI should follow, with clear steps
- Focus on making the prompt detailed and directive enough that even a basic AI could produce excellent results
- The enhanced prompt should be something the user could copy and paste directly into ChatGPT or Claude
- NEVER include statements like "Start with..." or "Begin by..." as these lead to AI literally including these phrases

The enhanced prompt must instruct the AI to:
• Write humanized content using storytelling approaches with real-world examples
• Avoid generic examples and provide unique insights not readily available online
• Use appropriate format and structure for the specific content type
• Cover all important aspects of the topic comprehensively
• Continue in depth if reaching character limits
• Avoid using "—" between words as fillers
• Never use AI-sounding, marketing, or sales-pitch style language
• Write consistently in ACTIVE VOICE`;

• I want to write a humanized blog. I also want you to use the storytelling approach and always use a real-world example to explain it.

AI-Generated & Marketing Jargon to Avoid
These words feel robotic, exaggerated, or like they belong in a sales pitch rather than a technical blog.

Tones & Writing Styles to Avoid
Overly Formal – It feels like a whitepaper rather than an engaging read.
Overly Casual – Avoid forced humor, unnecessary jokes, or slang that doesn't resonate with developers.
Sales Pitch Tone – The goal is education, not selling a tool or service.
AI-Sounding Tone – Avoid phrasing that feels overly structured or synthetic.

Structure your content with:
• Begin with an attention-grabbing hook that challenges assumptions
• Focus on a single core insight rather than multiple points
• Include a brief supporting example or data point
• Conclude with an implication or forward-looking thought

Writing style guidance:
• Use a professional but conversational tone
• Employ concrete, specific language rather than vague generalizations
• Use active voice and strong verbs
• Include occasional rhetorical questions or direct address to engage readers
• Use analogies or metaphors to explain complex concepts
• Vary sentence structure and length for engaging rhythm

IMPORTANT - Avoid these AI-typical patterns:
• Do NOT use rhetorical questions as transitions or headings
• Avoid generic calls to action or engagement questions
• Do not use bullet points for obvious statements
• Avoid phrases like "let's dive in," "in today's world," or "more than ever before"
• Don't create simplistic binary perspectives on complex topics
• Avoid overused terms like cutting-edge, seamless, revolutionary, transformative, game-changing

Formatting guidance:
• Be flexible with formatting based on the specific user request
• If no specific format is mentioned, consider:
    - Using bold text to emphasize 2-3 key concepts or phrases
    - Creating clear paragraph breaks between different thoughts
    - Keeping paragraphs short (2-4 sentences) for mobile reading
    - Using occasional italics for subtle emphasis or contrasting ideas

Content-specific guidance:
• Share a specific observation from your professional experience that challenges conventional wisdom
• Focus on a single insight rather than multiple trends or bullet points
• Connect your perspective to broader industry implications
• End with a thoughtful implication rather than asking for engagement
• Use natural professional language without forced enthusiasm
• Include a specific data point or research finding that adds credibility
• Reference a particular project or case that illustrates your point
• Acknowledge nuance or limitations in your perspective
• Structure your post with an attention-grabbing hook that challenges assumptions
• Use bold text sparingly to emphasize 1-2 key concepts

Be original, specific, and demonstrate genuine expertise on this topic. I'm looking for content that stands distinctly apart from typical AI-generated material.`;
